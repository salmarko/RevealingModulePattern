- As a user, I would like to send feedback for each page in app. 
- Feedback is in the form of Yes/No answer to the question "Was this page helpfull?". 
- Yes and No are buttons. 
- AJAX should be used for server request. 
- Response should have a message "Thanks for the feedback :). Your answer was *{Yes}/{No}*" shown to the user.
- If user already sent feedback for the current page, hide all info and show following message:  "You already sent feedback for this page.". JavaScript cookies are used to mark page as answered.
