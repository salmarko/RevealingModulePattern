- As a user, I would like to send feedback for each page in app, using AJAX for request. 
- Feedback is in the form of Yes/No answer to the question "Was this page helpfull?". 
- Response should have a message "Thanks for the feedback :). Your answer was *{Yes}/{No}*" shown to the user.
- Yes and No are buttons. 
- Yes and No buttons should have jqueryUI tooltip plugin attached to a Title attribute describing it's function.
